Patrick's Distributed Store, or Patrick David SebaRaj (me!), is an in-memory, sharded and replicated K/V store. It was created as my final project for CPSC 426 - Building Distributed Systems at Yale University.

I would like to give credit to the teaching staff of the course for such a great, interesting course that has taught me so, so much in just one semester. Furthermore, I would like to give credit for the testing suite (unit, integration, and stress) in this repository, which is based on the testing system of Lab4.
