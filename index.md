## PDS - Github Pages

Note: This is still a WIP. If you're looking for a more complete representation of my ability, check out GoGetItDone [here](https://sebaraj.com/GoGetItDone).

An eBay clone, built with Go and React. While the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/PSebaRaj/pBay-Frontend), I'm currently focusing on completing the backend, or at least getting most of the functionality built, before shifting my focus to the frontend.

Goal is to implement microservices, rather than the monolithic approach that was taken for my other projects (TradingPlatform, GoGetItDone, etc.), as well as implement RPCs (gRPC) for converting currencies, checking if user is chat banned, etc.
