## PDS - Github Pages

This was my final project for CPSC 426 - Building Distributed Systems at Yale. I'm currently adding more features to make this in-memory K/V store, which can act as a cache, to be as similar to [Memcached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached) as possible.

After completition of more features, I plan to replace Redis, which I utilize as a in-memory cache, in [GoGetItDone](https://sebaraj.com/GoGetItDone/). Furthermore, after I complete CPSC 437 - Database Systems in the Fall 2023 semester, I plan to make an object relational mapper (ORM) to replace gORM in in [GoGetItDone](https://sebaraj.com/GoGetItDone/). Thus, GoGetItDone will function with only my own libraries, Gorilla Mux (for networking), and PostgreSQL.
